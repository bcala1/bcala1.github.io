subtitle: PhD student in Chemical Oceanography

I am a PhD student at [NIOZ]{https://www.nioz.nl/en} and [Utrecht University]{https://www.uu.nl/en/research/department-of-earth-sciences}, advised by Matthew Humphreys, Olivier Sulpis and Mariette Wolthers. My research focuses on carbonate mineral dissolution in the ocean. More specifically, understanding what the drivers of dissolution are apart from the saturation state. In my project, I am combining laboratory experiments with field work, as well as modelling. Often, there is a gap between experimentalists and modellers and with my work I aim to bridge between them.

I very much enjoy diving into a new field and getting excited about different research topics. During my undergraduate degree, I spent a semester at the [National University of Singapore]{https://chemistry.nus.edu.sg} and worked on organometallic catalysis in the lab and a few months later, for my bachelor thesis in Chemistry at the [University of TÃ¼bingen]{https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/chemistry/welcome/}, it was all theoretical work in Computational Chemistry. I continued with modelling (but this time in Atmospheric Chemistry) during my MPhil at the University of Cambridge, updating and improving dimethyl sulfide oxidation in Earth System Models. For my PhD, I can now draw on all these experiences and combine different approaches and methodologies in one project. 

Outside of work, I cycle every few months through another creative hobby (painting, printmaking, knitting, cyanotype, photography, ....), I enjoy reading fiction and fantasy, and I am very passionate about buying and drinking tea. And I really like clouds.
