title: A bit more about me and my work
---
*Fore a more concise overview, see my CV.*

I am a PhD student at [NIOZ](https://www.nioz.nl/en) and [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/department-of-earth-sciences), advised by [Matthew Humphreys](https://www.nioz.nl/en/about/organisation/staff/matthew-humphreys), [Olivier Sulpis](https://www.deep-c.science/people/2095-olivier-sulpis) and [Mariette Wolthers](https://www.uu.nl/staff/MWolthers). My research focuses on carbonate mineral dissolution in the ocean. More specifically, we try to understand what the drivers of dissolution are apart from the saturation state. In my project, I am combining laboratory experiments with field work, as well as modelling. Often, there is a gap between experimentalists and modellers and with my work I aim to bridge between them. I am excited about machine learning (ML) approaches and try to learn more about it and how I can use it in my work. I think that ML is still underutilized in Environmental Sciences and Oceanography where it can be immensiley useful with the huge datasets that already exist.

I very much enjoy diving into a new field and getting excited about different research topics. During my undergraduate degree, I spent a semester at the [National University of Singapore](https://chemistry.nus.edu.sg) and worked on organometallic catalysis in the lab and a few months later, for my bachelor thesis at the [University of TÃ¼bingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/faculties/faculty-of-science/departments/chemistry/welcome/), it was all theoretical work in Computational Chemistry. I continued with modelling (but this time in Atmospheric Chemistry) during my MPhil at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.ch.cam.ac.uk), updating and improving dimethyl sulfide oxidation in Earth System Models. For my PhD, I can now draw on all these experiences and combine different approaches and methodologies in one project. 

Outside of research, I like reading (fiction, fantasy) and buying (and drinking) tea and I tend to get into another creative hobby (painting, printmaking, knitting, cyanotype, photography, ....) every couple of months. And I really, really like clouds.
