I am a PhD student at [NIOZ](https://www.nioz.nl/en) and [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/department-of-earth-sciences), supervised by Matthew Humphreys, Olivier Sulpis and Mariette Wolthers. In my research project "BEYÎ©ND the known drivers of marine carbonate mineral dissolution: closing the gap in the alkalinity budget" we try to do exactly that: figuring out what, how, and how much carbonate minerals dissolve in the world's oceans through laboratory experiments, field work and modelling.

## Updates
<!-- **December 2023:** It's again field work time! I am once again in the South Atlantic (and also Southern Ocean this time) to pick up my mooring experiment that we left there in February. I am on board the *RRS Discovery* for almost 6 weeks. -->

**November 2023:** The paper based on [my MPhil work is now published](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/23/14735/2023/acp-23-14735-2023.html) in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics! We compare how dimethyl sulfide (DMS) oxidation is implemented in different models and trying to improve it in UKCA (which is the atmospheric chemistry and aerosol model used in the UK's Earth system model) by adding a newly discovered (and quite important) intermediate  to the oxidation scheme. So why is this interesting? DMS might be very important in regulating the Earth's climate (check out the [CLAW hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLAW_hypothesis)) but until we don't understand more about the oxidation products of DMS we won't be able to assess its role in our climate system.

**October 2023:** I submitted the first paper from my PhD! The preprint can be found [here](https://essopenarchive.org/users/676280/articles/673892-synthesis-of-in-situ-marine-calcium-carbonate-dissolution-kinetic-measurements-in-the-water-column).

**April 2023:** I gave [a talk](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU23/EGU23-8433.html) at EGU23 in Vienna! 

**February 2023:**  Field work time! We spent over 3 weeks at sea in the South Atlantic on *RV Pelagia*. [Here](https://www.nioz.nl/en/blog/64pe513-blog-the-beyond-expedition) you can read more about the research and our experiences on board.
