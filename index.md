I am a PhD student at [NIOZ](https://www.nioz.nl/en) and [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/department-of-earth-sciences), supervised by Matthew Humphreys, Olivier Sulpis and Mariette Wolthers. In my research project "BEYÎ©ND the known drivers of marine carbonate mineral dissolution: closing the gap in the alkalinity budget" we try to do exactly that: figuring out what, how, and how much carbonate minerals dissolve in the world's oceans through laboratory experiments, field work and modelling.
